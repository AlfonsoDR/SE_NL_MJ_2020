# Noisy-Mutual-Inhibition
This is the code to implement the Circuit Model in "A neural circuit model for human sensorimotor timing" https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/712141v1.abstract

- The SAM, 1-2-Go and 1-2-3-Go simulations are implemented in SAM_simulations.ipynb
- The full circuit model, and simulations of the synchronization-continuation task are implemented in SynchronizationContinuation.ipynb
